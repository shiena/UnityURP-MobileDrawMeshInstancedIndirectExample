 Why create this repository?
 -------------
 To demonstrate an API that can draw millions of instance -> DrawMeshInstancedIndirect(), running on mobile devices.
 
 Can this demo runs on midrange mobile?
---------------
- can handle 10 million instances on Samsung Galaxy A70 (GPU = adreno612, not a strong GPU), 50~60fps, performance mainly affected by visible grass count on screen(draw distance = 125)
- can handle 10 million instances on Lenovo S5 (GPU = adreno506, a weak GPU), 30fps, performance mainly affected by visible grass count on screen(draw distance = 75)
 
 Requirement
 -----------------
 if you want to try the pre-built .apk, your android device must support Opengles3.2 / Vulkan

 Note
 -------------
 This is a simplified example repository to demonstrate DrawMeshInstancedIndirect API on mobile platform.  
 This repository is as simple as possible, only contains a simple CPU cell frustum culling(not even a quadtree) -> minimum compute GPU frustum culling (no Acceleration Algorithms), then just 1 DrawMeshInstancedIndirect call, nothing else, code is very short.
 
 Lighting and animation is not the main focus of this project, but ~40% of the time was spent on writing grass shader's lighting & animation, you can have a look at  InstancedIndirectGrass.shader if you are interested.  
 
 This repository also contains a RendererFeature(GrassBendingRTPrePass.cs) to render an offscreen RT(R8), which renders top down view grass bending area (by trail renderer following moving objects), it is a very simple method but the result is good enough for this demo.
